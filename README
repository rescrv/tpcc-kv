TPC-C for Key Value APIs
========================

This code comes from a `git rebase -i --root` of a private repo during my
thesis work.  It is unsupported at the moment.

Example:

``` #!/bin/zsh

set -e

WAREHOUSES=10
DISTRICTS=10
CLIENTS=100

./tpcc-kv setup consus
./tpcc-kv load-items consus &
for W in `seq $WAREHOUSES`
do
    ./tpcc-kv load-warehouse consus --warehouses $WAREHOUSES --warehouse $W &
done
wait
for W in `seq $WAREHOUSES`
do
    wait
done
for W in `seq $WAREHOUSES`
do
    for D in `seq $DISTRICTS`
    do
        ./tpcc-kv load-district consus --warehouses $WAREHOUSES --warehouse $W --districts $DISTRICTS --district $D &
    done
done
for W in `seq $WAREHOUSES`
do
    for D in `seq $DISTRICTS`
    do
        wait
    done
done
for c in `seq $CLIENTS`
do
    ./tpcc-kv run consus --output bench-${c}.dat --operations 1000 --warehouses $WAREHOUSES --districts $DISTRICTS &
done
for c in `seq $CLIENTS`
do
    wait
done
```
